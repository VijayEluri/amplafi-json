Code based on the original json.org code. Branch happened in late 2006.

Other json libraries documentation refer to the slowness of this library.

The modifications we made to the original library:
  1) ability to specify how to handle objects of different types. 
  2) serialization is not builtin to the object ( unlike java serialization is ) 
  3) ability for objects to self serialize ( like java serialization )
